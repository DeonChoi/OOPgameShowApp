# OOPgameShowApp
 Browser-Based, word guessing game using Javascript and OOP.

You can use the on-screen keyboard to guess the phrase or use your own physical keyboard. If you use your own physical keyboard, it will only accept alphabetic values (A-Z).
 
 Also there is a new animation ‘shake’ effect when you lose a life. The ‘lost heart’ icon will shake for 0.5 seconds.
